# The-Trends-of-Global-Terrorism-from-1999-to-2019

This is a project I did with a classmate from an undergraduate course in data analysis at University of Texas at Dallas.
We were interested in identifying patterns in the target types, location, and general tactics used in 
terrorism around the world from 1999 to 2019.
